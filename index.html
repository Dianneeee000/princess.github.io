    <h3>SELF INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Princess Dianne F. Pampola, a second-year student
         at Marinduque State College and an IT student. A young 
         dreamer, believer, and craving for success. I can't even 
         imagine that after my roller coaster journey as a child 
         and a teen, I am here in the adult world and have entered 
         the field of information technology. I never thought that 
         someday I could take this path, but I did. Despite the 
         difficulties that I have encountered and may encounter in 
         the future, I'm willing to give all of my best and determination 
         to be a successful person someday.</p>

    <h3>Background on Information Technology</h3>
    <p> I began my journey in information technology by 
        being clueless and curious that maybe the IT field 
        was cool and exciting. I was also encouraged by my 
        relatives that this course would open many opportunities 
        for me. But whoever knows, the encouragement and my 
        curiosity will bring me here to pursue the field of 
        information technology. During my journey in this course, 
        it made me realize that it was very different from what 
        I thought it was. It introduced me to different branches 
        of knowledge and broadened my understanding of software, 
        hardware, and networks. Aside from that, I slowly understood 
        different programming languages, their uses, and their functions. 
        All these learnings have changed the way I think about what IT is. 
        Though I've encountered some difficulties and pressure during my 
        journey here in IT, I'm still looking forward to the upcoming 
        knowledge and challenges that could sharpen my skills and deepen 
        my understanding so that I can share it with others in the future.</p>
